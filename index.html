            <h4>Software Support & Maintenance</h4>
            <p>"It’s a dirty job but somebody has to do it..." Sometimes it makes more sense to work with the software
                you have in place. Whether it’s a lack of documentation, performance issues or just a maintenance
                nightmare, we can help refactor, performance tune and document your software.</p>

            <h4>Software Process Improvement</h4>
            <p>Sometimes the problem isn’t with the software, but the process of building and releasing it. We can help
                you improve or establish a light-weight, repeatable process to develop and release software to your
                customers. Whether it’s configuration management, automated builds & unit testing, or a lack of
                standards & guidelines, we have "in the trench experience" with what works and what doesn’t.</p>
